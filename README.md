# Baker Street Corporation | Linux Server Hardening Report

## üß† Project Summary  
This system hardening project was conducted on a production-like Ubuntu 24.04 server used by Baker Street Corporation. The goal was to minimize attack surfaces, enforce best practices for access control, secure critical files and services, and automate recurring security tasks.

The engagement followed industry-standard hardening guidelines and included auditing users, removing insecure services, applying password policies, configuring firewalls, and validating log management settings.
